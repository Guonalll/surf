# Predictive Data Analytics for Urban Footfall

The posts will briefly summarise the first results that have come out of a project to predict footfall using machine learning methods. It was a collaboration beween:

 - Molly Asher, a data science intern at Leeds Institute for Data Analytics (who did almost all of the work!) - Nick Malleson, School of Geography (me)
 - Simon Brereton, Leeds City Council
