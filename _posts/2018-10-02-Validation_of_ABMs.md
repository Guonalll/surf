On 12th September 2018, I asked the [SIMSOC](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A0=SimSoc) email list for advice on how to validate an empirical agent-based model in the absence of good validation data. You can read the original message and the replies on the SIMSOC archives [here](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=SimSoc;d4e85e43.1809) and at the end of this post. The question lead to an interesting discussion, with around 20 messages posted to the list or to me personally. My colleague [Tomas Crols](http://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/t.crols) and [I](http://www.nickmalleson.co.uk/) have collated the responses and summarised them here. The response on SIMSOC was extremely useful for us; hopefully this summary is useful to others.

## Original Message on SIMSOC (available [here](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=SimSoc;d4e85e43.1809))

Hi SIMSOC, 
 
I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts/advice about a difficulty that I’m having with validating a model. This is in response to (very fair) comments by reviewers on a paper that is under review, so I will talk about the problem in general terms. I think the discussion should be of interest to others on the list. 
 
Colleagues and I have built a spatially-realistic agent-based model with agents who move around. It’s based on a real urban area. We have used an a-survey to calibrate the behavioural parameters, such that the agents behave in a way that is consistent with the results of the survey. The survey is national, so not specific to our study area. We put the agents into a virtual environment, let them go, and see what happens. 
 
The reason for creating this model in the first place is that we have no data on the spatial behaviour of the real individuals in our study area. So we’re hoping that by implement behaviour that is consistent with the results of the survey, the agents will give us some insight into the real dynamics of the case study area. 
 
But how do we validate the model? Assume that there are no empirical data available for our study area (it is possible to try to stand on the road and talk to people, but this is probably out of scope). What should an aent-based modeller do when they have an empirical model but no empirical validation data?? 
 
All the best, 
Nick
