I have just come across the [Urban Data Science Toolkit](http://www.udst.org/). The project seems to be a combination of a number of separate projects that are useful for urban modelling, including:

 - [UrbanSim](https://github.com/UDST/urbansim) - A model of real estate markets and transportation;

 - [Synthpop](https://github.com/UDST/synthpop) - A Population Synthesizer (a microsimulation model as far as I can tell);

 - [ActivitySim](https://github.com/UDST/activitysim) - An Activity-Based Travel model (this is the one that interests me the most).
 
All of the projects are part of the [UDST](https://github.com/UDST) github organisation.
