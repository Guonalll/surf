## **Call for papers:<br/>_Crime/fear in space and time_**

#### _[AAG 2016](http://www.aag.org/cs/annualmeeting). San Francisco. 29th March  2nd April_

The past two decades have seen a major expansion into the analysis of the spatial distribution of crime, with small scale or micro level analysis emerging at the forefront of place based research (Sherman et al., [1989](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-9125.1989.tb00862.x/abstract;jsessionid=C62E4EDE5A4FFEBC351A6B66496D619C.f04t03); Sherman and Weisburd, [2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12070/abstract)). This trend has been driven by both the increased availability of spatially referenced crime data, and the technological advances of software products that promote the analysis of the spatial clustering of crime (hot-spot analysis). However, this growth in spatial analysis is perhaps not reflected by similar advances in the temporal analysis of crime. Whilst a number of studies have examined the temporal patterns of crime (Ashby and Bowers, [2013](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/1)), these are not as prominent in the field as the spatial literature. As highlighted over 10 years ago, analysis of the temporal distribution of crime has failed to keep pace (Ratcliffe, [2002](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1013240828824)). This is still true today; the majority of studies linking potentially criminogenic places to elevated levels of crime across geographical units have been atemporal (Haberman and Ratcliffe,  [2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1745-9125.12076/abstract); Newton, [2015](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/content/4/1/11)).

This session aims to build on recent spatio-temporal work, such as the recent _[Crime Science](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/)_ special issue [Crime Patterns in Time and Space](http://www.crimesciencejournal.com/series/space-time). We invite methodological, theoretical and empirical papers that engage with any aspect of crime in place and time. Topics include, but are not limited to:

 - New methodologies for analysing crime/fear in space and time;
 - Daily routines/movement and impact on crime/fear of crime
 - Case studies involving analysis of crime/fear in space and time;
 - Policy analysis, predictive analytics, other applications of crime/fear in space and time;
 - Intensive modelling or simulation applied to crime/fear in space and time;
 - Individual-level and agent-based models (ABM) of geographical systems related to crime/fear;
 
Please e-mail the abstract and key words with your expression of intent to Andrew Newton ([a.d.newton@hud.ac.uk](mailto:a.d.newton@hud.ac.uk)) by 22nd October, 2015 (one week before the AAG session deadline).
