## **Call for papers<br/> _GeoComputation; the next 20 years_**

#### _Royal Geographical Society Annual International Conference 2016 ([RGS 2016](http://www.rgs.org/WhatsOn/ConferencesAndSeminars/Annual+International+Conference/Annual+international+conference.htm))._ London - Tuesday 30 August to Friday 2 September 2016.

The use of fully programmable computers to construct spatial models and run spatial analyses stretches back to the use of ENIAC to calculate ballistic courses during the Second World War. As ENIAC was announced to the public in 1946, 2016 represents the 70th year of the public use of computers in geography. Perhaps more happily, it is also 20 years since the term "GeoComputation" was invented to draw together a disparate set of geographers doing computing in the 70s, 80s, and 90s at the 1996 "1st International Conference on GeoComputation" in Leeds, UK. In 2017, the community built around this conference will be celebrating its 21st birthday, reflecting on its successes, and future directions. As part of this celebration, we invite presentations for this session speculating on the future of computing in geography: potentials, problems, and predictions. What is the future? The Internet of Things? Group cognition modelling? Solar-system scale geomorphological modelling? Speculative discussions encouraged!
