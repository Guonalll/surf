The <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/">Leeds Institute for Data Analytics</a> is please to present the next seminar in our series showcasing data analytics, taking place on November 23rd at 3.30pm in seminar room 8.34a, Level 8 Worsley Building. For full details see the <a href="http://lida.leeds.ac.uk/event/difficulties-reproducible-data-analytics-pitfalls-predictive-policing/">LIDA seminar series website</a>.

Our keynote speaker for this seminar is <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/secret/research/crime-security/geographical/students/toby-davies">Dr Toby Davies</a>, a lecturer in the Department of Security and Crime at UCL. His background is in mathematics, and his research is concerned with the application of quantitative methods to the modelling and analysis of crime. He has particular interest in the spatio-temporal characteristics of crime, and the modelling of these towards the end goal of crime prediction. In addition, his research involves the application of network science in the context of crime.

We also have talks from <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/m.adepeju">Dr Monsuru Adepeju</a> and <a href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/m.daws">Dr Matthew Daws</a>.

## Agenda

**5:30-15:50: [Dr Monsuru Adepeju](www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/m.adepeju) - Improving crime interventions using proactive hotspot policing**


Monsuru is a research fellow and currently working on a Home Office project, "More with Less: Authentic Implementation of Evidence-Based Predictive Patrol Plans". His current research interests cover predictive policing, geo-statistics and application of GIS to social-economic areas such as crime and health.

**15:50-16:25: [Dr Matthew Daws](href="https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/m.daws) - Reproducible research: assessing spatial predictions of crime**

Matt Daws is a research fellow in geography, working on a Home Office funded project, "Doing more with less". He previously worked as a Java developer in the financial sector, and in a previous life was an academic mathematician. He is interested in computational aspects of spatial analysis, and in Bayesian approaches to modelling.

**16:25-17:00 : [Dr Toby Davies](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/scs/people/profiles/toby-davies) - Developments and challenges in crime prediction**

Toby Davies is a lecturer in the Department of Security &amp; Crime Science at UCL. His background is in mathematics, and his research is concerned with the application of quantitative methods to the modelling and analysis of crime. He has particular interest in the spatio-temporal characteristics of crime, and the modelling of these towards the end goal of crime prediction. In addition, his research involves the application of network science in the context of crime.
