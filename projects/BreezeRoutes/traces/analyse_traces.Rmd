# Analyse Traces

An extension to the [map_traces.Rmd](./map_traces.Rmd) program. This has the facility to map traces, but focusses on analysing the difference between matched paths and their equivalent shortest path.

The three different kinds of routes that the script reads are:

 - original traces (the original GPX data)
 - matched routes (the original data matched to OSM routes)
 - shortest paths (the shortest paths the could be used to do the same route)

# Function to map a trace

It is sometimes useful to visualise a particualr trace. This has come from [map_traces.Rmd](./map_traces.Rmd) - see that file for proper documentation.

```{r map.trace.function }

expanded.bb <- function(bounds) {
  
  bb <- bbox(bounds)
  # Make the bounding box x % larger to make sure none of the map is clipped
  width = bb[1,2] - bb[1,1]
  height = bb[2,2] - bb[2,1]
  x <- 0.10 # 20 % larger in total
  bb[1,1] = bb[1,1] - (width*x)
  bb[1,2] = bb[1,2] + (width*x)
  bb[2,1] = bb[2,1] - (height*x)
  bb[2,2] = bb[2,2] + (height*x)
  return(bb)
}

# A convenience for plotting a trace given a filename relative to cwd
map.file <- function(filename) {

  # Create SpatialLinesDataFrames for the track
  track <- readOGR(dsn=filename, layer="tracks", verbose=FALSE )  
  # Project to WGS 84 / Pseudo Mercator (epsg:3857) for OSM
  track.merc <- spTransform(track, CRS("+init=epsg:3857"))
  
  bb <- expanded.bb(track@bbox)

  # Get an OSM basemap (coordinates are upper-left and lower-right)
  basemap <- openmap(
    upperLeft = c(bb[2,2],bb[1,1]), # Upper-left (lat,lon) (y,x)
    lowerRight = c(bb[2,1], bb[1,2]), # Lower-right
    type='osm', zoom=17)

}

map.trace <- function(orig, matched, short, osm=TRUE) {
  # Get a bounding box for the whole dataset to make sure plots are big enough
  # Need to do this before projecting otherwise openmap() doesn't work (not sure why)
  bb <- expanded.bb(orig@bbox)

}

```

# Read the Data

Read all of the traces and store in memory. Only read 'matched' traces because those will definitely have an original trace and a shortest path. Not all original traces have been matched by the MapMatcher program.

*NOTE: in practice this script wont ever read the data. It takes too long. Instead, use the `analyse-traces-server\*.R`scripts to read the data in simulataneously and then use the `collate_traces.R` script to bring the four separate .RData files together into a single TRACES_FILE that this script will read.*

```{r readTraces}

if (!file.exists(TRACES_FILE)) {
  
  stop("Error - the TRACES_FILE does not exist so I can't read the traces. You need to use the read-traces-server*.R scripts to read the data first and save an RData file with the traces in.")
  
} else {
  print(paste("Loading traces from file", TRACES_FILE))
  load(TRACES_FILE)
}

# No longer using the non-transformed versions for anything, so delete them
# (I could delete them from the TRACES_FILE, but that would mean more changes to the code and re-running
# the trace analysis on the server)
# Note: 'matched' isn't deleted because this is used to create the 'all.routes' data later and getting rid of it now would mean redoing lots of the maps. It isn't used in the analysis though so doesn't really matter.
rm(orig, shortest)

```

Read `r length(matched.ma)` matched traces, `r length(orig.ma)` original traces, and `r length(shortest.ma)` shortest paths.

# Filter Bad Matches

Earlier in the data anlysis process, clean traces were filtered out (see `2-breeze-analyse_data.Rmd`). This removed traces that, e.g. were too short to be useful. Now clean out traces that have not been matched to a given accuracy threshold (i.e. the shortest and matched traces are substantially different.)

Need to decide what 'outliers' are. Try the mean+1sd (red lines) and Q3+1.5*IQR (blue lines).

```{r findBadMatchedPaths, fig.height=20 }

# Calculate the lenths of the paths
orig.lengths    <-  unlist(mclapply(orig.ma, FUN=gLength))
matched.lengths  <- unlist(mclapply(matched.ma, FUN=gLength))
shortest.lengths <- unlist(mclapply(shortest.ma, FUN=gLength))

# Calclulate the path differences between shortest and matched
abs.diff <- mcmapply( # Absolute distance
  FUN=function(a,b) {return(abs(a-b))},
  orig.lengths, matched.lengths
)
rel.diff <- mcmapply( # Absolute relative (percentage) difference
  FUN=function(a,b) {return(abs(100*(a-b)/a))},
  orig.lengths, matched.lengths
)
diff <- mcmapply( # Difference
  FUN=function(a,b) {return(a-b)},
  orig.lengths, matched.lengths
)

summary(diff)
summary(abs.diff)
summary(rel.diff)

# Make margins smaller temporarily
margins <- par("mar")
par(mfrow=c(5,2), mar = rep(2, 4))
boxplot(diff, main="Difference between matched\nand original paths) (m)")
boxplot(diff, main="(short axis)", ylim = c(-500,400))
boxplot(abs.diff, main="Abslute Difference (m)")
boxplot(abs.diff, main="(short axis)", ylim = c(0,1000))
boxplot(rel.diff, main="Abslute Relative (percentage) Difference (m)")
boxplot(rel.diff, main="(short axis)", ylim = c(0,200))

hist(abs.diff, breaks="Scott", main="Histogram of absolute difference", xlab="Difference (m)")
abline(v=mean(abs.diff)+1*sd(abs.diff), col="red")
abline(v=quantile(abs.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(abs.diff)), col="blue")

hist(abs.diff, breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,3000), main="(short axis)")
abline(v=mean(abs.diff)+1*sd(abs.diff), col="red")
abline(v=quantile(abs.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(abs.diff)), col="blue")

hist(rel.diff, breaks="Scott", main="Histogram of relative difference", xlab="Percentage Difference (m)")
abline(v=mean(rel.diff)+1*sd(rel.diff), col="red")
abline(v=quantile(rel.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(rel.diff)), col="blue")

hist(rel.diff, breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,200), main="(short axis)", xlab="Percentage Difference (m)")
abline(v=mean(rel.diff)+1*sd(rel.diff), col="red")
abline(v=quantile(rel.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(rel.diff)), col="blue")

par(mar=margins)

```

It looks like the mean is pulled a lot by very severe outliers in the top end -- one trace has a difference between the original and the matched of `r max(abs.diff)`m! There are only `r length(which( abs.diff>(mean(abs.diff)+2*sd(abs.diff)) | rel.diff>(mean(rel.diff)+2*sd(rel.diff))))` traces that would be removed using the mean as the definition as an outlier, but `r length(which(abs.diff>(quantile(abs.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(abs.diff)))|rel.diff>(quantile(rel.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(rel.diff)))))` that would be removed using the quartile definition. This is quite a lot (too many) but will do for now.


```{r filterBadMatchedPaths}

#bad.indices <- which( abs.diff>(mean(abs.diff)+2*sd(abs.diff)) | rel.diff>(mean(rel.diff)+2*sd(rel.diff)))
bad.indices <- which( 
  abs.diff>(quantile(abs.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(abs.diff))) | 
  rel.diff>(quantile(rel.diff)[4]+(1.5*IQR(rel.diff)))
  )

#orig <- orig[-bad.indices]
#shortest <- shortest[-bad.indices]
matched <- matched[-bad.indices]
orig.ma <- orig.ma[-bad.indices]
matched.ma <- matched.ma[-bad.indices]
shortest.ma <- shortest.ma[-bad.indices]
userid <- userid[-bad.indices]
starttime <- starttime[-bad.indices]
endtime <- endtime[-bad.indices]

# Delete old variables
rm(abs.diff, bad.indices, diff, rel.diff)

```

After filtering, there are `r length(matched.ma)` matched traces, `r length(orig.ma)` original traces, and `r length(shortest.ma)` shortest paths.

These were created by `r length(unique(unlist(userid)))` separate users.

This is a god point to create a single SpatialLines object from the discrete Lines (traces).

```{r createSingleLine}
# Use a consistent projection. 
# Note: could use Albers to be consistent throughout (and use 'matched.ma' below rather than 'matched') but this would mean redoing the maps. It doesn't affect the analysis.
PROJ4STRING <- matched[[1]]@proj4string

# Begin by creating a single SpatialLines object of all matched lines (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18023462/how-to-unlist-spatial-objects-and-plot-altogether-in-r)

#  Get the Lines objects which contain multiple 'lines'
# Note: using the non-Albers (*.ma) projected routes. I sohould really be using the projected versions to be consistent, but this would mean re-doing all the maps. This doesn't actually affect the results though so I'm going to leave it as it is for now.
lines.objects <- unlist( mclapply( matched , function(x) `@`(x , "lines") ) )
# Give each an ID based on its index
for (i in seq(1,length(matched))) { lines.objects[[i]]@ID <- as.character(i) }

# Make a SpatialLines object from all of those lines
all.routes <- SpatialLines(lines.objects, proj4string = PROJ4STRING)

# Write it out (for mapping etc., not for anlaysis)
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(all.routes, data=data.frame(seq(1,length(all.routes)))), dsn="./routes-shp/", layer="all_routes", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

#  Also make one bg SpatialLines object for mapping. Begin by extracting the individual 'lines'
individual.lines <- mclapply( lines.objects , function(y) `@`(y,"Lines") )
#  Combine them into a single SpatialLines object. This is good for quick plotting etc.
all.routes.oneline <- SpatialLines( list( Lines( unlist( individual.lines ) , ID = 1 ) ), proj4string = PROJ4STRING )
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(all.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result/", layer="all_routes_oneline", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)
rm(individual.lines, lines.objects)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(all.routes.oneline, axes=T, main="All Traces")

# Useful to analyse in a GIS
#writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(all.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(1)), dsn=".", layer="all_routes.shp",driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer=TRUE)

```


# Compare path distances

## Aggregate comparisons

### Actual paths v.s. shortest path

Look at the differences in the lengths between actual (matched) paths and shortest paths. The matched and original are very similar, and the shortest are shorter :-).

```{r compareLengthsHist1 }
# Need to recalculate lengths after filtering
orig.lengths    <-  unlist(mclapply(orig.ma, FUN=gLength))
matched.lengths  <- unlist(mclapply(matched.ma, FUN=gLength))
shortest.lengths <- unlist(mclapply(shortest.ma, FUN=gLength))

par(mfrow=c(1,3))
ylim <- c(0,10000)
xlim <- c(0,8000)

hist(orig.lengths,     breaks='Scott', xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim )
hist(matched.lengths,  breaks='Scott', xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim )
hist(shortest.lengths, breaks='Scott', xlim=xlim, ylim=ylim )
```

```{r compareLengthsHist2 }
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
d <- density(shortest.lengths, kernel="gaussian") # Remember first density plot so parameters can be reused
plot(d, col="blue", main="Trip distance distribution")

lines(density(orig.lengths, kernel="gaussian", bw=d$bw), col="grey")
lines(density(matched.lengths, kernel="gaussian", bw=d$bw), col="black")
legend("topright", c('Shortest', 'Original', 'Matched'), col=c('blue', 'grey', 'black'),lty=1)

```

```{r compareLengthsBoxPlot}
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
boxplot(list("Original"=orig.lengths,"Matched"=matched.lengths,"Shortest"=shortest.lengths),ylim=c(0,5000), main="Path distances (short y axis)", ylab="Path distance")
```

### Hausdorff distances

Look at the Hausdorff distances between the paths. This quantifies how similar the paths are.

```{r hausdorffDistancesHist1} 
# Run using lapply as above. This is just slightly more complicated because the distance function requires two 
# arguments as it compares two lines. mapply does this. The function comes first, followed by the arguments 
haus.orig.matched <- unlist(
  mcmapply(
    FUN=gDistance, # Function to calcuate the distance
    orig.ma, matched.ma, # First two arguments
    MoreArgs=list(byid=FALSE, hausdorff=TRUE) # Some other named argments
  )
)
haus.matched.shortest <- unlist(
  mcmapply(
    FUN=gDistance, # Function to calcuate the distance
    matched.ma, shortest.ma, # First two arguments
    MoreArgs=list(byid=FALSE, hausdorff=TRUE) # Some other named argments
  )
)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
xlim=c(0,1000)
ylim=c(0,10000)
hist(haus.orig.matched, main="Hausdorff distance\nOriginal v.s. Matched", xlab="Distance", breaks="Scott",xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim)
hist(haus.matched.shortest, main="Hausdorff distance\nMatched v.s. Shortest", xlab="Distance",  breaks="Scott",xlim=xlim,ylim=ylim)

```

```{r hausdorffDistancesHist2} 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
d <- density(haus.orig.matched, kernel="gaussian")
plot(d, main="Hausdorff distance distribution", col="grey", xlim=c(0,2000))
lines(density(haus.matched.shortest, kernel="gaussian", bw=d$bw), col="black")
legend("topright", c('Matched - Original','Matched - Shortest'), lty=1, col=c('grey','black'))

```

```{r hausdorffDistances2} 
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
boxplot(list("Matched<->Original"=haus.orig.matched, "Matched<->Shortest"=haus.matched.shortest), main="Hausdorff Distances (short y axis)",ylim=c(0,1000))

```



## Disaggregate (shortest-matched comparisons)

### Difference between shortest and matched (normalised)

Calculate the normalised difference between the shortest and matched paths. The plot the distribution of these differences.

```{r compareDisaggDistsances, fig.width=10, fig.height=10 }

absolute.diffs <- matched.lengths - shortest.lengths
# Normalise to range 0->1
absolute.diffs.n1 <- ( absolute.diffs - min(absolute.diffs) ) / (max(absolute.diffs) - min(absolute.diffs))
# Normalise by dividing by the shortest path
absolute.diffs.n2 <- absolute.diffs / shortest.lengths

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(absolute.diffs.n1, breaks="Scott", xlab="Difference", main="Absolute trip distance differences.\nNormalised to range 0->1 ")
hist(absolute.diffs.n1, breaks="Scott", xlab="Difference", xlim=c(0.05,0.15), main="(shorter x axis)" )

hist(absolute.diffs.n2, breaks="Scott", xlab="Difference", main="Absolute trip distance differences.\nNormalised by dividing by shortest path")
hist(absolute.diffs.n2, breaks="Scott", xlab="Difference", xlim=c(0,2), main="(shorter x axis)" )

```

Try plotting the most different matched routes - those that are Q3+1.5*IQR meters (`r quantile(absolute.diffs)[4] + ( 2 * IQR(absolute.diffs))`m) longer than their shortest counterparts)

```{r visualiseDifferentPaths, fig.width=15}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))

plot(all.routes, xlim=c(-71.2,-71.0), ylim=c(42.2,42.45), 
     main="Matched routes with very different \n shortest paths (absolute difference)")
plot(all.routes[ which(absolute.diffs>quantile(absolute.diffs)[4]+(2*IQR(absolute.diffs)) ) ],
    col="blue", add=T )

plot(all.routes,  xlim=c(-71.2,-71.0), ylim=c(42.2,42.45), 
     main="(Normalised by shortest path)")
plot(all.routes[ which(absolute.diffs.n2>quantile(absolute.diffs.n2)[4]+(2*IQR(absolute.diffs.n2)) ) ],
     col="blue", add=T )

```

_Nothing particularly interesting there so far .._

### Hausdorff and actual difference in distances travelled

Compare the Hausdorff and relative distances travelled in one plot (for the paper).

```{r hausdorff.and.actual.difference, fig.height=15}

par(mfrow=c(2,1))

# Actual distance

rel.diff.distance <- ( matched.lengths - shortest.lengths ) / matched.lengths
hist(rel.diff.distance, breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,3300), main="Relative (proportional) difference in\ndistances travelled", xlab="Relative difference (matched trace - shortest trace)")

# Hausdorff
hist(haus.matched.shortest, breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,1000), ylim=c(0,10000), main="Hausdorff path differences", xlab="Hausdorff difference (matched - shortest)")

# Both on same graph

#d <- density(haus.matched.shortest, kernel="gaussian")
#plot(d, col="blue", xlim=c(0,1500), ylim=c(0,0.006), main="")
#lines(density(abs.diff.distance, kernel="gaussian", bw=d$bw), col="black")
#legend("topright", c('Hausdorff Distance','Actual Difference'), lty=1, col=c('blue','black'))

# Do a pdf for the paper
pdf(file="hausdorff_and_actual_difference.pdf", width = 7, height = 11.69)
par(mfrow=c(2,1))
rel.diff.distance <- ( matched.lengths - shortest.lengths ) / matched.lengths
hist(rel.diff.distance, breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,1), ylim=c(0,3300), main="Relative (proportional) difference in\ndistances travelled", xlab="Relative difference (matched trace - shortest trace)")
hist(haus.matched.shortest, breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,1000), ylim=c(0,10000), main="Hausdorff path difference", xlab="Hausdorff difference")
dev.off()


```



# Explore User distances

Look at the range of distances travelled by individual users. Is there some regularity?

First the number of traces per user.

```{r userDistances}
# Improved histogram for integers (https://mikelove.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/r-one-liner-histogram-for-integers/)
int.hist = function(x,ylab="Frequency",...) {
  barplot(table(factor(x,levels=min(x):max(x))),space=0,xaxt="n",ylab=ylab,...);axis(1)
}

# First find the frequency distribution of trips per user

uid.freq = as.data.frame(table(as.factor(unlist(userid))))
int.hist(uid.freq$Freq, main="Traces per user", xlab="Number of traces", ylab="Frequency (number of users)")
```

Now look at the distributions of mean and standard deviations

```{r userDistancesDist}

# A list of users and their total distances. Uses data.table. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11782030/sum-by-distinct-column-value-in-r
uid.total.dists <- data.table(
  "userid"=unlist(userid), 
  "orig.lengths"=unlist(orig.lengths), 
  "matched.lengths"=unlist(matched.lengths), 
  "shortest.lengths"=unlist(shortest.lengths), 
  key="userid")
# Now sum that data table
uid.total.dists <- uid.total.dists[,list(sum(orig.lengths), sum(matched.lengths), sum(shortest.lengths), (.N) ), by=userid]
names(uid.total.dists) <- c("userid", "orig", "matched", "shortest", "N")

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
boxplot(list(
  "Orig"=uid.total.dists$orig/uid.total.dists$N, 
  "Shortest"=uid.total.dists$matched/uid.total.dists$N,
  "Matched"=uid.total.dists$matched/uid.total.dists$N),
  main="Average distances\ntravelled per user (m)",
  ylab="Mean distance travelled (m)")
boxplot(list(
  "Orig"=uid.total.dists$orig/uid.total.dists$N, 
  "Shortest"=uid.total.dists$matched/uid.total.dists$N,
  "Matched"=uid.total.dists$matched/uid.total.dists$N),
  main="(short y axis)",
  ylim=c(0,3000))

  - Calculate symmetry of M
  - Look at places that are not symmetrical.
  
**For the similarity analysis only work with the matched traces**
  
## Define study area

Need to define the  (the area that qualitatively contains most of the flows)

```{r defineStudyArea}

# Define the study area (the area that qualitatively contains most of the flows)
study.area.bb <- all.routes.oneline@bbox
study.area.bb[1,1] <- -71.2 # x min
study.area.bb[1,2] <- -71.0 # x max
study.area.bb[2,1] <-  42.26 # y min
study.area.bb[2,2] <-  42.42  # y max
#study.area.bb[1,1] <- -7920375 # x min
#study.area.bb[1,2] <- -7908295 # x max
#study.area.bb[2,1] <-  5206223 # y min
#study.area.bb[2,2] <-  5221410 # y max

# These could be used when projection is Albers (epsg:5070) (not tested)
#study.area.bb[1,1] <-  2007000 # x min
#study.area.bb[1,2] <-  2024700# x max
#study.area.bb[2,1] <-  2406300# y min
#study.area.bb[2,2] <-  2422000# y max

study.area.coords <- rbind(
  cbind(study.area.bb[1,1],study.area.bb[2,1]),
  cbind(study.area.bb[1,1],study.area.bb[2,2]),
  cbind(study.area.bb[1,2],study.area.bb[2,2]),
  cbind(study.area.bb[1,2],study.area.bb[2,1])
)

# Make a polygon from the bounding box
study.area <- SpatialPolygons(list(Polygons(list(Polygon(study.area.coords)), ID = 1)), proj4string = PROJ4STRING)

#writeOGR(SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(study.area, data=data.frame(c(1))) , dsn = "./", layer="study_area", driver="ESRI Shapefile")

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(all.routes.oneline, axes=T, main="All Traces and the Study Area")
points(study.area.coords, col="red")
plot(study.area, col=rgb(1, 0, 0,0.3), add=T)

```

## Make the grid (will become the transition matrix)

Now create a regular grid that covers the study area. This will be used to create the transition matrix

```{r makeGridForTransitionMatrix, fig.width=15}

# The number of cells per row or column
num.cells <- 20
total.cells <- num.cells ** 2

# Create the grids - adapted from Brunsdon & Comber (2015, p150)
cell.width <-  (study.area.bb[1,2] - study.area.bb[1,1]) / num.cells
cell.height <- (study.area.bb[2,2] - study.area.bb[2,1]) / num.cells

#cell.areas <- c(cell.areas, (cell.width * cell.height) ) # Also remember the cell area for later

centre.x <- study.area.bb[1,1] + ( cell.width / 2 )
centre.y <- study.area.bb[2,1] + ( cell.height / 2 )

# Make the grid
grd <- GridTopology(
  cellcentre.offset = c(centre.x, centre.y), # No offset, the grid will just cover all the points
  cellsize = c(cell.width, cell.height),
  cells.dim = c(num.cells, num.cells)
  )

# Convert it into a polygons data frame, and give each cell it's x and y locations in the matrix (-1 initially)
grid <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame(
  as.SpatialPolygons.GridTopology(grd),
  data = data.frame("ID"=rep.int(-1,total.cells),"CellX"=rep.int(-1,total.cells),"CellY"=rep.int(-1,total.cells)),
  match.ID = FALSE
  )
proj4string(grid) <- PROJ4STRING
rm(grd)
# Set the ID properly and keep a record of the (x,y) coordinates and associated ID
grid.ids <- matrix(data=0, nrow=num.cells, ncol=num.cells)
cellcount <- 1
for (rowcount in seq(1,num.cells)) {
  for (colcount in seq(1,num.cells)) {
    grid@data[cellcount,]$CellX <- colcount
    grid@data[cellcount,]$CellY <- rowcount
    grid@data[cellcount,]$ID <- cellcount
    grid.ids[rowcount,colcount] <- cellcount
    cellcount <- cellcount + 1
  }
}

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(grid, border='blue', main="Routes and the grid")
plot(all.routes.oneline, add=T)

#plot(grid, border='blue', main="Grid labels")
#polygonsLabel(grid, paste('(',grid$CellX,',',grid$CellY,')', sep=""), cex=0.4 )

```

The grid consists of `r num.cells` cells, with a mean square area of `r mean(raster::area(grid))/(1000**2)` km^2^.




## Calculate transition matrix, M

Process:

 1. Iterate over each cell
    1. Clip the traces within the cell
    1. Iterate over each (sub) trace
      - Identify one of three possible conditions

      1. The line begins in the cell
        - Increment the _departure_ count, for the appropriate direction (N,S,E,W)
      1. The line passes through the cell
         - Increment the _departure_ count for the appropriate direction (N,S,E,W)
      1. The line ends in the cell
         - Do nothing.
      1. The line is wholly contained within the cell
         - XXXX WHAT DO DO?! Check Ratti paper


The following functions do the analysis. They're defined here and then executed in the next chunk.

### Define matrix functions


```{r defineTransitionMatrixFunctions}

### Make the matrix

Calculate the transition matrix! This will take some time, use loads of memory (especially if in multi-threaded mode) and heat up your computer. Good luck.

```{r makeMatrix, cache=TRUE}

# Calulate the flows into and out of cells. This makes a list with lots of information
result1 <- calc.flows(grid, all.routes, plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)

# Convert that list of results to a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
result1.spdf <- result.to.spdf(result1) 

# Finally make a transition matrix 
result1.matrix <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.spdf, grid.ids)

# Write out the matrix
#write.csv(result1.matrix, file="/Users/nick/Desktop/result1.csv")
writeOGR(result1.spdf, dsn = "result", layer="result1_spdf", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

# Save the objects - easy to read back in (now done later)
#save(result1, result1.spdf, result1.matrix, num.cells, total.cells, file="results.RData")

```

_The code below is for testing the algorithm, it defines a few test routes and makes a small grid_

```{r makeTrasitionMatrixTest, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

# Make a tiny grid for testing
num.cells <- 10
total.cells <- num.cells ** 2
cell.width <-  (71.07-71.05) / num.cells
cell.height <- (42.37-42.344) / num.cells
centre.x <- -71.07 + ( cell.width / 2 )
centre.y <- 42.344 + ( cell.height / 2 )
grd2 <- GridTopology(cellcentre.offset = c(centre.x, centre.y), cellsize = c(cell.width, cell.height), cells.dim = c(num.cells, num.cells) )
grid2 <- SpatialPolygonsDataFrame( as.SpatialPolygons.GridTopology(grd2), data = data.frame("ID"=rep.int(-1,total.cells),"CellX"=rep.int(-1,total.cells),"CellY"=rep.int(-1,total.cells)),match.ID = FALSE  )
rm(grd2)
proj4string(grid2) <- PROJ4STRING
# Set the ID properly
grid2.ids <- matrix(data=0, nrow=num.cells, ncol=num.cells)
cellcount <- 1
for (rowcount in seq(1,num.cells)) {
  for (colcount in seq(1,num.cells)) {
    grid2@data[cellcount,]$CellX <- colcount
    grid2@data[cellcount,]$CellY <- rowcount
    grid2@data[cellcount,]$ID <- cellcount
    grid2.ids[rowcount,colcount] <- cellcount
    cellcount <- cellcount + 1
  }
}

# Temporarily choose a few routes for testing

# Plot the test grids and routes
plot(grid2, border='blue', main="Grid labels")

plot(test.routes, add=T)

```

### Comparing in- and out-flows for symmetry

As all flows in-to and out-of a cell involve an interaction with only one of the four possible von Neumann neighbours, we can test the symmetry of traces passing through each cell by calculating the flow in-to and out-of each cell as a 4-element vectors (_fin(i)_ and _fout(i)_ respectively). Then the _relative flow_ (_frel(i)_)can be defined as the magnitude difference between the _fin(i)_ and _fout(i)_ vectors. If all traces are symmetrical, then for all cells the number of traces entering the cell from each direction will be equal to the number of traces leaving from the same direction.

```{r relativeFlowSymmetry}

# Calculate the flows in-to and out-of each cell in each direction using the transition matrix

rel.flow <- c() # Relative flow in each cell (absoulte difference between fin and fout vetors for each cell)
total.flow <- c() # Useful for percentages

calc.flow <- function(o,d) { # Calculate flow from o to d, checking for boundary errors
    if ( o > total.cells || o < 1 || d > total.cells || d < 1) {
      return (0)
    } else {
      return(result1.matrix[o,d])
    }
}

# Iterate over all cells 
for (cell in seq(1, total.cells)) {
  
  # Work out which cell IDs make up the von Neuman neighbours of the curent cell. These are used to index into the transition matrix
  n <- cell - num.cells # (number of cells per row)
  e <- cell +1
  s <- cell + num.cells
  w <- cell -1
  
  # Flows into the cell from N E S W. Note that matrix is accessed by mat[y,x] (not x,y)
  fin <- c(
    calc.flow(n,cell), # N
    calc.flow(e,cell), # E
    calc.flow(s,cell), # S
    calc.flow(w,cell) # W
  )
  fout <- c(
    calc.flow(cell, n), # N
    calc.flow(cell, e), # E
    calc.flow(cell, s), # S
    calc.flow(cell, w) # W
  )
  # Relative flow is the Euclidean distance between inflows and outflows
  frel <- dist(rbind(fin, fout))
  rel.flow <- c(rel.flow, frel)
  
  # Also remember the total flow
  total.flow <- c(total.flow, result1[[cell]]$total.intersection)
  
}


```

Lets see the distribution of total and relative flows

```{r relativeFlowSymmetry-Distributions }


par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(rel.flow, breaks="Scott", main="Distribution of relative flows", xlab=expression("f"["rel"]*"()."))
hist(rel.flow/total.flow, breaks="Scott", main="Relative flow proportions", xlab=expression("f"["rel"]*"()/total_flow."))

# And one for the paper
pdf(file="relative_flow_symmetry-distributions.pdf", width = 7, height = 7)
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(rel.flow, breaks="Scott", main="Distribution of relative flows", xlab=expression("f"["rel"]*"()."))
hist(rel.flow/total.flow, breaks="Scott", main="Relative flow proportions", xlab=expression("f"["rel"]*"()/total_flow."))
dev.off()



```

Map those relative flows

```{r relativeFlowSymmetry-Distributions2, fig.width=11, fig.height=7}

# Attach the relative flows to the spatial data frame for mapping
result1.spdf@data$rel.flow <- rel.flow # Relative flow
result1.spdf@data$rel.flow.prop <- rel.flow/total.flow # proportion (catching zero division)
result1.spdf$rel.flow.prop[is.nan(result1.spdf$rel.flow.prop)] <- 0

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
choropleth(result1.spdf, result1.spdf@data$rel.flow, main="Relative flow asymmetry, frel()")
choropleth(result1.spdf, result1.spdf@data$rel.flow.prop,  main = "Proportions - frel()/total.flows")

```

_At this point write out the result1 data frame as a shapefile and make a map in ArcGIS_

## Within-cell flow

Compute incoming and outgoing flows for each cell and see if they're semetrical.

```{r withinCellFlows}

inflow <- colSums(result1.matrix)
outflow <- rowSums(result1.matrix)

# Make a linear model to quantify difference in flows (degree of symmetry)
within.cell.model <- lm(inflow~outflow)

par(mfrow=c(1,1))
plot(inflow,outflow, main="Within-Cell Flows", xlab="In Flow", ylab="Out Flow")
# abline(within.cell.model, col="red")
abline(a=0,b=1,col="gray", lty=3)
#legend("topright", legend=c("x=y","Model"), col=c("black","red"), lty=1 )
legend("topright", legend=c("x=y"), col=c("gray"), lty=3 )

# And one for the paper
pdf(file="within_cell_flow_correlation.pdf", width = 7, height = 7)
plot(inflow,outflow, main="Within-Cell Flows", xlab="In Flow", ylab="Out Flow")
abline(a=0,b=1,col="gray", lty=3)
legend("topright", legend=c("x=y"), col=c("gray"), lty=3 )
dev.off()


# The correlation
cor(inflow,outflow)

```

Whilst they're not symmetrical, they are very similar. The correlation is `r cor(inflow,outflow)`

The following shows the distribution of the flows:

```{r withinCellDistribution}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(inflow,  breaks="Scott")
hist(outflow, breaks="Scott")
plot(density(inflow))
plot(density(outflow))

```

## Pairwise flow

Now look at the flows between cells. The aim is to see whether the matrix is symmetrical, i.e. M=M^T^. Following the Ratti paper, constuct absolute and relative _difference matrix_.

```{r pairwiseFlows}

result1.abs.diff.matrix <- matrix(NA,nrow=nrow(result1.matrix),ncol=ncol(result1.matrix))
result1.rel.diff.matrix <- matrix(NA,nrow=nrow(result1.matrix),ncol=ncol(result1.matrix))


for ( i in seq(1,nrow(result1.matrix))) {
  for (j in seq(1, ncol(result1.matrix))) {
    if (i <= j) { # Don't need bottom half of the matrix, it will be identical to top half ('triangular')
      maximum <- max(result1.matrix[i,j],result1.matrix[j,i])
      # Absolute and relative difference (ignoring cells with no flows, where max=0, which will stay as NA)
      if (maximum > 0) {
        result1.abs.diff.matrix[i,j] = abs(result1.matrix[i,j] - result1.matrix[j,i])
        result1.rel.diff.matrix[i,j] = abs(result1.matrix[i,j] - result1.matrix[j,i]) / maximum
      }
    }
  }
}
# Sanity check: the number of non-zero items in each matrix should be the same
stopifnot(length(which(result1.abs.diff.matrix>0)) == length(which(result1.rel.diff.matrix>0)) )
# Also all relative flows should be in range [0,1]
stopifnot(length(result1.rel.diff.matrix[which(result1.rel.diff.matrix<0 | result1.rel.diff.matrix>1)]) == 0)

#write.csv(result1.abs.diff.matrix, file="/Users/nick/Desktop/result1_abs_diff.csv")
#write.csv(result1.rel.diff.matrix, file="/Users/nick/Desktop/result1_rel_diff.csv")

```

There are `r length(which(result1.abs.diff.matrix>0))` non-zero flows. Note: in the results matrices, NA indicates no flow between i,j, whereas 0 represents no _difference_ in the flow.

Summary information: 

 - Absolute flows: `r summary(result1.abs.diff.matrix[which(result1.abs.diff.matrix>0)])`
 - Relative flows: `r summary(result1.rel.diff.matrix[which(result1.rel.diff.matrix>0)])`

Now calculate the _percentage of of asymmetry_

```{r pairwiseFlow-percentage_asymmetry}


calculate.asymmetry <- function(the.matrix) {
  sum.absolute.flow <- 0
  sum.max.flow <- 0
  for ( i in seq(1,nrow(the.matrix))) {
    for (j in seq(1, ncol(the.matrix))) {
      if (i < j) { # Discard bottom half of matrix *and* don't include where i==j
        sum.absolute.flow <- sum.absolute.flow + abs(the.matrix[i,j] - the.matrix[j,i])
        sum.max.flow <- sum.max.flow + max(the.matrix[i,j], the.matrix[j,i] )
      }
    }
  }
  percentage.asymmetry <- sum.absolute.flow / sum.max.flow
  return(percentage.asymmetry)
}
result1.percentage.asymmetry <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix)
```

The percentage asymmetry is `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry,5) * 100`%. Therefore asymmetric flows account for `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry,2) * 100`% of all flows, or people change their routes `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry,2) * 100`% of the time.

## Map(s) of Asymmetric Flows

First map the number of traces that pass through each cell. For the final paper I atually do this in ArcMap.

```{r mapTracesPerCell, fig.width=15}

shades <- auto.shading(result1.spdf$total.intersection, n=9, cutter=quantileCuts)
choropleth(result1.spdf, result1.spdf$total.intersection, shading = shades)
choro.legend("topleft", sh=shades)
plot(all.routes.oneline, add=T, col=rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5))

```


## Sensitivity to grid size

See how sensitive the asymmetry is to the choice of grid size by running a few grids and comparing the asymettry for each.

```{r sensitivity.to.resolution }

# XXXX HERE

```


## Shortest path choice v.s. symmetry

It will be interesting to see if there is some relationship between the choice to take the shortest path and the path symmetry. I.e. is the chioce to deviate from the shortest path related in some way to route asymmetry? Or are the chioces independent. Explore this as follows:

 1. Subset the **longest traces relative to their shortest path** (i.e. those which are at least 20% longer than their shortest). **There are `r length(which( matched.lengths >= (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths))` / `r length(shortest.lengths)`** of these.
 1. Remove them from the data set, leaving on only the shortest relative routes.
 1. Repeat the asymmetry analysis on the remaining (shortest-path like) traces.
 1. Calculate the aggregate asymmetry value:
   - If it ramains similar (~15%) then the shortest-path and asymmetry choices are independent.
   - If not, then there may be a correlation between the two choices.  
 1. **Repeat using the 'non-longest' relative path routes (i.e. thost that were not included in the above analysis).** **There are `r length(which( matched.lengths < (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths))` / `r length(shortest.lengths)`** of these.. 


```{r createSubsets, fig.width=15}

# The longest routes are those where the matched length is at least 20% greater than the equivalent shortest path.
relative.longest.indices <-  which( matched.lengths >= (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths)
# Also repeat with the remaining 'non-longest' routes (i.e. all other routes)
relative.shortest.indices <- which( matched.lengths < (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths)

relative.shortest <- matched[relative.shortest.indices]
relative.longest <-  matched[relative.longest.indices]

# Sanity check - the number of elements in the two subsets should be the same as in the original data.
stopifnot( (length(relative.longest)+length(relative.shortest)) == length(shortest.ma)   )

# That gives lists of traces. Need to convert these into a single lines dataframe. See an explanation for how do do this in the chunk called 'createSingleLine'
create.single.line <- function(list.of.traces, oneline=FALSE) {
  #  Get the Lines objects which contain multiple 'lines'
  lines.objects <- unlist( mclapply( list.of.traces , function(x) `@`(x , "lines") ) )
  # Give each an ID based on its index
  for (i in seq(1,length(list.of.traces))) { lines.objects[[i]]@ID <- as.character(i) }
  
  if (oneline) { # Make a single Lines object, for mapping
    individual.lines <- mclapply( lines.objects , function(y) `@`(y,"Lines") )
    return(SpatialLines( list( Lines( unlist( individual.lines ) , ID = 1 ) ), proj4string = PROJ4STRING ) )
  } else { # Make a SpatialLines object from all of those lines
    return(SpatialLines(lines.objects, proj4string = PROJ4STRING) )
  }

}
  
relative.shortest.routes <- create.single.line(relative.shortest)
relative.longest.routes  <- create.single.line(relative.longest)

# Also make a single SpatialLines object for mapping (and write it out)
relative.shortest.routes.oneline <- create.single.line(relative.shortest, oneline = TRUE)
relative.longest.routes.oneline <- create.single.line(relative.longest, oneline = TRUE)
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(relative.shortest.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result", layer="relative_shortest_routes_oneline", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE )
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(relative.longest.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result", layer="relative_longest_routes_oneline", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE )


# Also write out a shapefile with individual lines in it (again for mapping at MIT, not copied from server)
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(relative.shortest.routes, data=data.frame(seq(1,length(relative.shortest.routes)))), dsn="./routes-shp/", layer="relative_shortest_routes", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(relative.longest.routes, data=data.frame(seq(1,length(relative.longest.routes)))), dsn="./routes-shp/", layer="relative_longest_routes", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

# Make a plot now.

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#plot(relative.longest, main="longest")
#plot(all.routes[ which( matched.lengths >= (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths)], main="longest")
plot(relative.longest.routes, main="longest")
plot(study.area, add=T, border="blue")
#plot(relative.shortest, main="not longest")
#plot(all.routes[ which( matched.lengths < (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths) ], main="not longest")
plot(relative.shortest.routes, main="not longest")
plot(study.area, add=T, border="blue")


```

This results in `r length(relative.longest)` longest paths and `r length(relative.shortest)` non-longest paths (_I don't want to say 'shortest' because a shortest path is the equivalent route that someone could have taken but might not have done_).

As a sanity check, make sure that the 'longest' paths are actually longer!

```{r longestPath-sanityCheck, fig.width=15}

# First the longest:

longest.lengths <- unlist(mclapply(relative.longest, gLength ))
summary(longest.lengths)

# Now the shortest:
shortest.lengths <- unlist(mclapply(relative.shortest, gLength ))
summary(shortest.lengths)

# And a histogram
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(longest.lengths, main="Longest path lengths", breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0,4000))
hist(shortest.lengths, main="Non-longest path lengths", breaks="Scott", xlim=c(0,0.1), ylim=c(0,4000))

# So as not to confuse things later:
rm(longest.lengths, shortest.lengths)

```

Now re-do the asymmetry analysis but with these path subsets (see the chunk called `makeMatrix` for an explanation)

```{r rerunAsymmetryAnalysis-longestPaths, cache=TRUE}
# This repeasts the code in `make matrix` chunk

# Calulate the flows into and out of cells. This makes a list with lots of information
result1.longest  <- calc.flows(grid, relative.longest.routes,  plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)
result1.shortest <- calc.flows(grid, relative.shortest.routes, plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)
# Convert that list of results to a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
result1.longest.spdf  <- result.to.spdf(result1.longest) 
result1.shortest.spdf <- result.to.spdf(result1.shortest)
# Finally make a transition matrix 
result1.matrix.longest  <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.longest.spdf, grid.ids)
result1.matrix.shortest <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.shortest.spdf, grid.ids)

# Write out the matrices
#write.csv(result1.matrix, file="/Users/nick/Desktop/result1.csv")

# Not re-writing out the shapefiles because I have done some analysis in ArcMap (see description below)

#writeOGR(result1.longest.spdf,  dsn = "result", layer="result1_longest_spdf",  driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)
#writeOGR(result1.shortest.spdf, dsn = "result", layer="result1_shortest_spdf", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

# Save the objects (these as well as the original results) - easy to read back in (now done later)
#save(result1, result1.spdf, result1.matrix, num.cells, total.cells, 
#     result1.longest, result1.shortest, result1.longest.spdf, result1.shortest.spdf, 
#     result1.matrix.longest, result1.matrix.shortest,

**NOTE: after writing out the above shapefiles (`result1_longest_spdf` and `result1_shortest_spdf`) I load them into ArcMap and calculate the _proportions_ of flows passing through each cell to allow for comparisons on maps. I should do this here, but to do it properly (rather than added on at the end) it would mean re-running all of the analysis which will take ages.** 

The ArcMap (python) formula to calculate the proportion of flows from the total per cell is:

` 0 if !ttl_ntr! == 0 else !ttl_ntr! / x` 

where `x` is the total number of traces in the data set. I couldn't work out how to get this total directly in the formula so had to hard code it, i.e. _`r sum(result1.longest.spdf@data$total.intersection)`_ for the longest and _`r sum(result1.shortest.spdf@data$total.intersection)`_ for the shortest. I made a new field called `prop_ntr` and used this to create the map '`result-shortest_vs_longest`'.

Now recalculate the asymetry for the longest and shortest paths.

```{r recalculateAsymmetry-longestPaths}

result1.percentage.asymmetry.longest  <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.longest)
result1.percentage.asymmetry.shortest <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.shortest)

```

The asymmetry values for longest and shortest paths are:

 - For *Longest*: The percentage asymmetry is `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry.longest,5) * 100`%. Therefore asymmetric flows account for `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry.longest,2) * 100`% of all flows, or people change their routes `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry.longest,2) * 100`% of the time.

 - For *Shortest*: The percentage asymmetry is `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry.shortest,5) * 100`%. Therefore asymmetric flows account for `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry.shortest,2) * 100`% of all flows, or people change their routes `r round(result1.percentage.asymmetry.shortest,2) * 100`% of the time.



## Weekday/weekend v.s. symmetry

Repeat the previous analysis (comparing path symmetry for longest and shortest paths) but this time comparing paths on the weekend and weekday.

*NOTE: the start and end times of the trips might be out by one hour, because I didn't know what the UTC offset should be for each trace (see notes in analyse_traces-server\*.R for an explanation). This wont adversely affect the weekday/weekend analysis, but the times should not be used for analysis of trip start/end times.*

Begin by creating subsets for the weekend and weekday.

```{r createWeekdayEndSubsets, fig.width=15}

# Filter weekday and weekend traces. Use the starttime list, which is a separate list that has the time that each journey started
# (this was extracted in the read_traces-server*.R file as it required interrogating the original GPX files)

stopifnot( length(starttime) == length(matched) ) # (Sanity check - there should be a start time for each route)

# Create a vector that, rather than the actual start time, just has the number of the day (0-6 starting on Sunday)
day.of.week <- unlist(lapply(starttime, FUN= function(x) as.POSIXlt(x)$wday))
stopifnot(max(day.of.week) == 6 & min(day.of.week) == 0 ) # Sanity check - days must be 0-6

# For info, lets have a histogram of the days
hist(day.of.week, main="Days of the week when trips started", xlab="Day (Sunday -> Monday)")

# Subset weekdays v.s. weekends
weekday.indices <- which(day.of.week==0 | day.of.week==6) # Sunday (0) or Saturday (6)
weekend.indices <- which(day.of.week > 0 & day.of.week < 6) # Weekdays
stopifnot( length(starttime) == ( length(weekday.indices) + length(weekend.indices)) )

weekday.list <- matched[weekday.indices]
weekend.list <- matched[weekend.indices]
stopifnot( (length(weekday.list)+length(weekend.list)) == length(matched) )

# That gives lists of traces. Need to convert these into a single lines dataframe. See 'create.single.line' defined earlier.
weekday.routes <- create.single.line(weekday.list)
weekend.routes <- create.single.line(weekend.list)

# Also make a single SpatialLines object for mapping (and write it out)
weekday.routes.oneline <-  create.single.line(weekday.list, oneline = TRUE)
weekend.routes.oneline <- create.single.line(weekend.list, oneline = TRUE)
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(weekday.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result", layer="weekday_routes_oneline", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE )
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(weekend.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result", layer="weekend_routes_oneline", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE )

# Make a plot now.

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#plot(relative.longest, main="longest")
#plot(all.routes[ which( matched.lengths >= (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths)], main="longest")
plot(study.area, border="blue")
plot(weekend.routes, main="weekend routes", add=T)
plot(study.area, add=T, border="blue")
#plot(relative.shortest, main="not longest")
#plot(all.routes[ which( matched.lengths < (shortest.lengths*0.2)+shortest.lengths) ], main="not longest")
plot(study.area, border="blue")
plot(weekday.routes, main="weekday routes", add=T)
plot(study.area, add=T, border="blue")


```

There were `r length(weekday.indices)` trips during weekdays, and `r length(weekend.indices)` trips over the weekend (out of a total of `r length(starttime)` trips).


Re-run the analysis for the weekday and weekend paths

```{r rerunAsymmetryAnalysis-weekdayEnd, cache=TRUE }

# This repeasts the code in `make matrix` chunk

# Calulate the flows into and out of cells. This makes a list with lots of information
result1.weekday <- calc.flows(grid, weekday.routes, plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)
result1.weekend <- calc.flows(grid, weekend.routes, plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)
# Convert that list of results to a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
result1.weekday.spdf <- result.to.spdf(result1.weekday) 
result1.weekend.spdf <- result.to.spdf(result1.weekend)
# Finally make a transition matrix 
result1.matrix.weekday <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.weekday.spdf, grid.ids)
result1.matrix.weekend <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.weekend.spdf, grid.ids)

writeOGR(result1.weekday.spdf, dsn = "result", layer="result1_weekday_spdf",  driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)
writeOGR(result1.weekend.spdf, dsn = "result", layer="result1_weekend_spdf", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

# Save the objects (these as well as the original results) - easy to read back in
save(result1, result1.spdf, result1.matrix, num.cells, total.cells, 
     result1.longest, result1.shortest, result1.longest.spdf, result1.shortest.spdf, 
     result1.matrix.longest, result1.matrix.shortest,
     result1.weekday, result1.weekend, result1.weekday.spdf, result1.weekend.spdf,
     result1.matrix.weekday, result1.matrix.weekend,
     file="results.RData")

```

Re-calculate the asymmetry values for weekday and weekend trips.

```{r recalculateAsymmetry-weekendDay, cache=TRUE}

result1.percentage.asymmetry.weekday <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.weekday)
result1.percentage.asymmetry.weekend <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.weekend)

```

Asymettry values:

 - Weekday asymetry: `r result1.percentage.asymmetry.weekday`

 - Weekend asymetry: `r result1.percentage.asymmetry.weekend`


## Absolute Route Length

Now the analysis moves on from comparing deviations from the shortest possible path, to comparing the asymmetry assocated with **absolute path length**. The hypothesis here is that route length might impact on pedestrian decisions.  The rationale is that we might know quite well our neighborhood, so that we take shortest path for short walks, while we might significantly deviate from shortest path for longer routes where we haven’t full knowledge of the environment.

To do this the methodology remains unchanged: subset the traces into 'short' and 'long' by absolute length and then repeat the asymmetry analysis for those two subsets.

Begin by creating subsets for the absolute longest and shortest trips.

```{r createAbsoluteSubsets, fig.width=15}

# Filter on absolute trip length

# First need to decide what constitutes a 'long' and 'short' trip. The data are quite skewed, so use the median as it is less affected by extreme values.
matched.lengths.mean <- mean(matched.lengths)
matched.lengths.median <- median(matched.lengths)

hist(matched.lengths, breaks="Scott", main="Distribution of absolute path lengths")
abline(v=matched.lengths.mean, col='red')
abline(v=matched.lengths.median, col='blue')
legend("topright", legend = c('mean', 'median'), col=c('red','blue'), lty=c(1,1))

absolute.longest.indices <-  which(matched.lengths >= matched.lengths.median)
absolute.shortest.indices <- which(matched.lengths <  matched.lengths.median)
# Sanity check
stopifnot( length(absolute.shortest.indices) + length(absolute.longest.indices) == length(matched.lengths) )

absolute.longest <-  matched[absolute.longest.indices]
absolute.shortest <- matched[absolute.shortest.indices]
# Sanity check
stopifnot( length(absolute.shortest) + length(absolute.longest) == length(matched.lengths) )

# That gives lists of traces. Need to convert these into a single lines dataframe. See 'create.single.line' defined earlier.
absolute.longest.routes  <- create.single.line(absolute.longest)
absolute.shortest.routes <- create.single.line(absolute.shortest)

# Also make a single SpatialLines object for mapping (and write it out)
absolute.longest.routes.oneline  <- create.single.line(absolute.longest,  oneline = TRUE)
absolute.shortest.routes.oneline <- create.single.line(absolute.shortest, oneline = TRUE)

writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(absolute.longest.routes.oneline,  data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result", 
         layer="absolute_longest_routes_oneline",  driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE )
writeOGR(SpatialLinesDataFrame(absolute.shortest.routes.oneline, data=data.frame(c(1)) ), dsn="./result", 
         layer="absolute_shortest_routes_oneline", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE )

# Make a plot.

par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot(study.area, border="blue", main="Absolute Longest Routes")
plot(absolute.longest.routes, add=T)
plot(study.area, add=T, border="blue")
plot(study.area, border="blue", main="Absolute Shortest Routes")
plot(absolute.shortest.routes, add=T)
plot(study.area, add=T, border="blue")

```

There were `r length(absolute.longest.indices)` long trips, and `r length(absolute.shortest.indices)` short trips.

Re-run the analysis for the absolute long and short trips.

```{r rerunAsymmetryAnalysis-absoluteLengths, cache=TRUE }
# This repeasts the code in `make matrix` chunk

# Calulate the flows into and out of cells. This makes a list with lots of information
result1.absolute.longest  <- calc.flows(grid, absolute.longest.routes,  plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)
result1.absolute.shortest <- calc.flows(grid, absolute.shortest.routes, plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)

# Convert that list of results to a SpatialPolygonsDataFrame
result1.absolute.longest.spdf  <- result.to.spdf(result1.absolute.longest ) 
result1.absolute.shortest.spdf <- result.to.spdf(result1.absolute.shortest)

# Finally make a transition matrix 
result1.matrix.absolute.longest  <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.absolute.longest.spdf,  grid.ids)
result1.matrix.absolute.shortest <- spdf.to.matrix(result1.absolute.shortest.spdf, grid.ids)

writeOGR(result1.absolute.longest.spdf, dsn = "result", layer="result1_absolute_longest_spdf",  driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)
writeOGR(result1.absolute.shortest.spdf, dsn = "result", layer="result1_absolute_shortest_spdf", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

# Save the objects (these as well as the original results) - easy to read back in
save(result1, result1.spdf, result1.matrix, num.cells, total.cells, 
     result1.longest, result1.shortest, result1.longest.spdf, result1.shortest.spdf, 
     result1.matrix.longest, result1.matrix.shortest,
     result1.weekday, result1.weekend, result1.weekday.spdf, result1.weekend.spdf,
     result1.matrix.weekday, result1.matrix.weekend,
     result1.absolute.longest, result1.absolute.shortest, result1.absolute.longest.spdf, result1.absolute.shortest.spdf,
     result1.matrix.absolute.longest, result1.matrix.absolute.shortest,
     file="results.RData")

```

Re-calculate the asymmetry values for weekday and weekend trips.

```{r recalculateAsymmetry-absoluteLengths, cache=TRUE}

result1.percentage.asymmetry.absolute.longest  <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.absolute.longest )
result1.percentage.asymmetry.absolute.shortest <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.absolute.shortest)

```

Asymettry values:

 - Asymetry for absolute **longest** routes: `r result1.percentage.asymmetry.absolute.longest`

 - Asymetry for absolute **shortest** routes: `r result1.percentage.asymmetry.absolute.shortest`






## Asymmetry Analysis for Anthony

AV would also like to calculate relative asymmetry for an area that he is working on 

**This doesn't work at the moment; problem with find.nsew not correctly reporting the edges that lines pass through**

```{r av.temp}
# To stop the Rmd breaking as the code below isn't run.
av.result.percentage.asymmetry <- 99

```


```{r AV.asymmetry.analysis, cache=FALSE, eval=FALSE }

# Read the grid to use
av.grid.temp <- readOGR( ds = "./tony_grid/", layer="BC Square Grid")

# Project it so that it matcches the traces
av.grid <- spTransform(av.grid.temp, CRS(proj4string(all.routes))) # "+init=epsg:4326 +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0"
rm(av.grid.temp)

# Add ID, CELLX and CELLY columns. These are needed so that the algorithn knows which cells neighbour each other
total.av.cells <- nrow(av.grid)
num.av.cells <- sqrt(nrow(av.grid)) # Cells per row or column (it's a square grid so these will be the same) 
av.grid$ID <- -1
av.grid$CellX <- -1
av.grid$CellY <- -1
av.grid.ids <- matrix(data=0, nrow=num.av.cells, ncol=num.av.cells)
cellcount <- 1
for (rowcount in seq(1,num.av.cells)) {
  for (colcount in seq(1,num.av.cells)) {
    av.grid@data[cellcount,]$CellX <- colcount
    av.grid@data[cellcount,]$CellY <- rowcount
    av.grid@data[cellcount,]$ID <- cellcount
    av.grid.ids[rowcount,colcount] <- cellcount
    cellcount <- cellcount + 1
  }
}


# ***************************

av.result.percentage.asymmetry <- -1 # TEMPORARILY IN CASE FOLLOWING DOESN'T WORK AND BREAKS MARKDOWN compilation
save.image(file="analyse_traces-temp.RData")

# ***************************
# Do the analysis

av.result <-  calc.flows(av.grid, all.routes,  plot=FALSE, multithread = TRUE)

# NOTE CHANGE TO spdf.to.matrix() - changed conditions from y>0 to y>1 (and same with x). Re-run to check this doesn't influence the results.

av.result.spdf <- result.to.spdf(av.result) 
writeOGR(av.result.spdf, dsn = "tony_grid", layer="av_result_spdf", driver="ESRI Shapefile", overwrite_layer = TRUE)

# Make the results matrix
av.result.matrix <- spdf.to.matrix(av.result.spdf, av.grid.ids)

av.result.percentage.asymmetry <- calculate.asymmetry(result1.matrix.shortest)

```

In Anthony's data, the percentage asymmetry is `r round(av.result.percentage.asymmetry,5) * 100`%. Therefore asymmetric flows account for `r round(av.result.percentage.asymmetry,2) * 100`% of all flows, or people change their routes `r round(av.result.percentage.asymmetry,2) * 100`% of the time.


# Anonymise and Save Workspace

It is useful to save all these data so that it isn't necessary to re-run everything. There is aso a companion script that removes individual traces if necessary. 



```{r saveWorkspace}

save.image(file="analyse_traces.RData")

```
