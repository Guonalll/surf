                	<h2>Abstract</h2>
                	
                	<h2>Agent-based modelling is proving itself to be an extremely valuable approach to understanding and modelling social systems. In particular, the treatment of individuals directly - rather than through aggregate statistical rules - places it in an ideal position to model dynamical systems that depend on the actions and interactions of numerous individuals. Part of the success of the methodology can be attributed to its interdisciplinarity; researchers from disciplines ranging from sociology and psychology to computer science and physics have contributed to its development. </h2>

					<h2>However, agent-based modelling has yet to incorporate some key ideas from fields such as meteorology, particularly with respect to improving models dynamically in response to streams of new data. Part of the explanation of this absence can be attributed to data availability - only recently have data sources begun to emerge that have the spatio-temporal resolution and volume to warrant the incorporation of methods similar to those used in the environmental sciences.</h2>
	
					<h2>This paper begins to address this gap by experimenting with an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) as a means of dynamically assimilating data into an agent-based model of urban dynamics. The paper will demonstrate that an agent-based model coupled to an EnKF can be a reliable means to dynamically improve predictive models in response to streaming data such as that arising from social media or through devices that count the number of people passing certain points. Importantly, these data do not need to track individuals, which reduces the ethical risks associated with such invasive surveillance. Ultimately the model presented here will be used to create estimates of the size of the population at risk to phenomena such as crime victimisation or to ill health as a result of exposure to air-borne pollutants.</h2>
