					<h2>Abstract</h2>
                    
					<p class="small">An understanding of how people move around cities is vital for building up reliable estimates of the population at risk for phenomena that vary in space and time. For example, to reliably assess the disease burden of air pollution on a population it is important to understand when and where the activities of individuals intersect with pollution hotspots. However, modelling dynamic populations is extremely difficult as most well-established data sources contain sparse information about non-residential activities. Fortunately, emerging data sources such as those arising through the use of social media or loyalty cards hold the promise of providing more reliable information about non-residential daily activities. The challenge, therefore, is to create a high-resolution model of urban flows that is able to take advantage of good quality residential and non-residential data sources.</p>

					<p class="small">This research proposes an original approach: to use agent-based modelling as the tool to bring together disparate data sources and create an accurate, high-resolution model of individual-level daily urban flows. The model will draw on advances from disciplines such as meteorology to dynamically calibrate the agent-based model as new data streams become available. Ultimately the results of the simulation will be married to estimates of pollutant concentrations to estimate the disease burden of some pollutants. Preliminary results illustrate that the model holds promise as a reliable tool for modelling the ambient urban population.</p>
