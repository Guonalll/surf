/**
  * Classes to represent agents
  *
  * ==Overview==
  *
  * The base class for all agents is [[surf.abm.agents.Agent]], which provides the basic parameters and methods required
  * by all agents.
  *
  * The [[surf.abm.agents.UrbanAgent]] class extends the basic agent functionality by adding the ability of agents
  * to move around a road network
  *
  * [[surf.abm.agents.RandomRoadAgent]] is a concrete implementation of an [[surf.abm.agents.UrbanAgent]] that
  * moves randomly from home to a randomly chosen [[surf.abm.environment.Building]] and back again.
