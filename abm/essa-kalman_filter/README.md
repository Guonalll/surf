# Kalman Filter Example

This is the example presented at the ESSA Social Simulation Conference (SSC) on 26th September 2017 in
Dublin. It shows how to use an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to assimilate data into a simple
agent-based model.

The slides explaining the work are available on the [Simulating Urban Flows
website](http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/p/2017-09-26-essa-da.html)
