# Kalman Filter Data Assimilation Example

This is the example presented at the ESSA [Social Simulation Conference (SSC)](http://www.sim2017.com/) on 26th September 2017 in Dublin. It shows how to use an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) to assimilate data into a simple
agent-based model.

The slides explaining the work are available on the [Simulating Urban Flows
website](http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/p/2017-09-26-essa-da.html) and the full paper is available <a href="http://surf.leeds.ac.uk/p/2017-09-26-essa-da.pdf">here</a>.

The main file is [kalman.py](./kalman.py) and the model (which is less important) is [workingcameras.py](./workingcameras.py).
