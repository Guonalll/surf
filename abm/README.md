# Agent-Based Modelling Code

This directory will store the code for the various flavours of the ABM built to model daily routine activities. 

 - The main model is: **[surf-abm](./surf-abm)**
 - **[surf-dda](./surf-dda/)** is a vastly simplified version that I started developing to test dynamic data assimilation techniques. Now superseded by:
 - **[dda-mesa](./dda-mesa/)** - a python implementation using the [mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa/) library, with model and Kalman Filter code heavily dependent on Alice Tapper's work during her internship at Leeds
