# BurgdSim Source Code

This is the source code for Nicks PhD burglary model (called BurgdSim). It was developed using Repast and although it's technically open source I've never gotten round to putting it online.

The most useful thing to use for the surf-abm is the PECS behaviour framework stuff. I intend to use a cut-down version of that framework here.
